Photography Gallery
========
-Created by Pablo Fernandez.

This is a dynamically generated photo gallery that automatically resizes and adds watermarks to the photographers images. Each photo gallery
is randomly generated with a combination of all related photos, and features a built-in cart function for photo licensing.

Improvements to the photo gallery are welcome. I am open to suggestions to improve the efficiency of the code or add additional functionality.
